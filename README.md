# 1. Installation:
   No additional libraries to run the code beyond the anaconda distribution of python. Python version 3 should be used to run the code.


# 2. Project Motivation:

In this project, I was interested in examining patients characteristics by finding answers to the following questions:
1- Who most likely to miss his appointment and who wouldn't?
2- Do remainder messages help patients remember their appointments?
3- Can we predict who is going to show up at the appointment?

# 3. File Descriptions:

There is one notebook included here to demonstrate the work done to answer the above questions. Markdown cells were used to guide you through the steps.

# 4. Results:
The main findings can be found in this post.
