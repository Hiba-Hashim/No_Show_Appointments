## 1. Installation: <a name="installation"></a>

No additional libraries to run the code beyond the anaconda distribution of python. Python version 3 should be used to run the code.


## 2. Project Motivation: <a name="motavation"></a>

In this project, I was interested in examining patients characteristics by finding answers to the following questions:
1- Who most likely to miss his appointment and who wouldn't?
2- Do remainder messages help patients remember their appointments?
3- Can we predict who is going to show up at the appointment?

## 3. File Descriptions: <a name="f_descriptions"></a>

There is one notebook included here to demonstrate the work done to answer the above questions. Markdown cells were used to guide you through the steps.

## 4. Results: <a name="Result"></a>

The main findings can be found in this [post](https://medium.com/@hiba.fallatah/can-we-guess-who-can-make-his-appointment-to-the-doctors-73ff70efeb70).
